Task Overview:

%Introduction @ Carlo
-- RL requires HITL
-- xAI is essential for HITL
++ Reread

%Background - general perspectives, what is xAI, IL
- xAI @ Payam, Carlo
-- importance of xAI
-- xAI and trust 
-- examples for explaining models, explaining behavior and predictions, and inherent explanations
++ Reread and ensure consistent story

- IL @ Christabel, Srijita
-- what is IL
-- Human as Teacher, UI/Reward Shaping, Action Pruning
++ Focus on fundamentals of IL approaches

- Challenges
-- RL and HITL challenges

%% Steps - what do we have, what needs to be modified

%Developing RL Models @ Tianpei, Mohammed
-- requires breadth and depth, comparability, but can be complex and cost intensive
-- pre-training, model interpretability, codify model and query policies
++ Reread and ensure consistent story

%Agent Learning @ Srijita, Cristabel
-- requires reduced complexity and interactivity
-- use CFs, PBL, IL, Querying
++ Reread and ensure consistent story
++ Refactor 2nd gen approaches into "Further considerations" subsection
++ Move pure IL topics back into the background

%Model Testing @ Anna, Alessa
-- requires coping with scale and language of experts
-- policy summarization, graph-based explanations
++ Reread and ensure consistent Story

%Deployment
-- requires to be fast, computable, understandable
-- xAI approaches, error handling/startup

%Discussion @ Matt
- Challenges
- Gen3
++ Reread and ensure consistent story

%Conclusion @ Carlo
++ summarize paper and give team-up outlook@Carlo
