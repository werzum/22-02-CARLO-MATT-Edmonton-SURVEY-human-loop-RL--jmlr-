"++" - Stuff that needs to be done/inserted/rewritten..


Task Overview:

%General
++ N.N. please fill in author names
++ Read Introduction
++ Fix/redo headers and subsections @ Carlo

%Introduction @ Matt
-- RL requires HITL
-- xAI is essential for HITL

%Background - general perspectives, what is xAI, IL
- xAI @ Tianpei, Mohammed, Andreas
-- importance of xAI
-- xAI and trust 
-- examples for explaining models, explaining behavior and predictions, and inherent explanations
++ Insert programmatic citations
++ Talks about general explainability, apply it in the section

- IL @ Christabel, Srijita
-- what is IL
-- Human as Teacher, UI/Reward Shaping, Action Pruning
-- Application of xAI
++ Refactor so that we keep what is general, and move applications to chapters

- Causal Learning @ Payam, Anna
-- GNN, Counterfactuals, Insert Knowledge
++ refactor/move into interactive learning -> should IL be split? @06.05.2022

- Challenges @ Carlo
-- RL and HITL challenges
++ drive home the point that RL is hard and requires HITL @06.05.2022
++ drive home the point that HITL requires xAI

%% Steps - what do we have, what needs to be modified

%Developing RL Models @ Tianpei, Mohammed
-- requires breadth and depth, comparability, but can be complex and cost intensive
-- pre-training, model interpretability, codify model and query policies

%Agent Learning
-- requires reduced complexity and interactivity
-- use CFs, PBL, IL, Querying

%Model Testing @ Payam
-- requires coping with scale and language of experts
-- policy summarization, graph-based explanations
++ Rework content

%Deployment
-- requires to be fast, computable, understandable
-- xAI approaches, error handling/startup

%Discussion
- Challenges @ 

- Gen1,2,3
++ rework, ensure that everything is summarized nicely

- Considerations @ Alessa
-- Human Robot Teaming Vision
++ Rework/extend this so it fits in the discussion

%Conclusion
++ summarize paper and give team-up outlook
