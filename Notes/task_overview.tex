Task Overview:

%Reading
++ Go over entire paper @ everyone
    ++ Is it consistent?
    ++ What is superfluous?
    ++ Do you miss anything?

%Abstract
++ Update to reflect current scope of the paper @ Matt

%Introduction
-- RL requires HITL
-- xAI is essential for HITL

%Background - general perspectives, what is xAI, IL
- xAI
-- importance of xAI
-- xAI and trust 
++ Integrate first xAI categories into xRL @ Payam

- IL @ Christabel, Srijita
-- what is IL
-- Human as Teacher, UI/Reward Shaping, Action Pruning

- Challenges
-- RL and HITL challenges

%Developing RL Models @ Tianpei, Mohammed
-- requires breadth and depth, comparability, but can be complex and cost intensive
-- pre-training, model interpretability, codify model and query policies

%Agent Learning @ Srijita, Cristabel
-- requires reduced complexity and interactivity
-- use CFs, PBL, IL, Querying

%Model Testing @ Anna, Alessa
-- requires coping with scale and language of experts
-- policy summarization, graph-based explanations
++ Reread and ensure consistent Story

%Deployment
-- requires to be fast, computable, understandable
-- xAI approaches, error handling/startup
++ Reread and ensure consistent story @ Carlo

%Discussion @ Matt
-- Challenges
-- Gen3

%Conclusion @ Carlo
++ Reread @ Andreas
